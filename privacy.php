<p>Your privacy is the most important thing for me. Logging searches is sensitive topic.

<p>In no way the searches will be shared or search history or bookmarks shared withut explicit consent.

<p>As I add feature sharing will be enabled but it will be always opt-in model. You decide what you want to share and what not.

<p>Your privacy is the most important thing for us. Logging search history is sensitive topic.

<p>Since we follow opt-in model for privacy, we log only those queries that you have explicitly asked us to log.

<p>Why is it better than than letting search engine(Google/Bing/Yahoo) log your queries?

<p>They will either let you log all queries or none.

<p>Also they will log queries only for one search engine. Here you can log queries from any search engine(Google/Bing/Yahoo).
